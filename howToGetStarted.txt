The Speeduino can react on commands given on its serial ports. One of those ports is Speeduino’s usb port. This is also the port TunerStudio uses to communicate. 

Personally, I didn’t want to use that usb port. I prefer to use the usb cable only for TunerStudio and use another port for reading values with another Arduino. No hassle with changing cables.

Speeduino has a “secondary” port. You have to enable it in ‘Accessories’ in TunerStudio (See enableSecondarySerialInterface.png)

To make things complicated, Speeduino’s secondary port is associated with Arduino Mega’s “Serial3” port. Mega’s Serial3 can be found on the Mega pins 14 (transmit) and 15 (receive). 
See pinoutMega2560.png for their location.

You mission, should you choose to accept it, is to locate these pins on your Speeduino board and solder wires on them. In connectingPin14and15.jpg you can see what I did.

I preferred to protect the ports with resistors with a value of 10 k. The rationale is that if you accidentally short-circuit a wire no damage will be done. Since for the communication only very small currents are used, a resistor does no harm. 
I added two dupont pins for easy removal of the wires to the helper-arduino. 

The code for the helper Arduino can be found in SpeeduinoConsole.ino. 
In there you can read that the helper-arduino uses the pins 10 (receive) and 11 (transmit). The transmitter from the Speeduino (blue wire) must be connected with the receiver of the helper-arduino. The other (green wire) connects the receiver of the Speeduino with the transmitter of the helper. 

In helperArduino.jpg you can get an idea of the wiring of the help-arduino. I’m not sure if it is of any help. You can see the L78S05 voltage regulator that powers the helper-arduino. (I already burned the Speeduino regulator by overloading it, so this one gets his own regulator).
Maybe you can see a white cable. That is for future use (knock-detection).
